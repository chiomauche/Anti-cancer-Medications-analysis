To help a pharmaceutical company complete data from their most recent animal study, for treatment for squamous cell carcinoma(SCC).
In the study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured, thereby comparing the performance of a pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

. In the distribuation of the tumor volume of each mouse across four of the treatment regimens(Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin), it appears that mice treated with Ramicane exhibited the lowest median final tumor volume. Conversely, mice treated with Infubinol displayed the highest median final tumor volume, which was only slightly greater than the second-highest median final tumor volume observed among mice

. The Capomulin drug regimen shows a highly significant positive correlation between the weight of the mice and the average tumor volume, with a correlation coefficient of 0.84.
